**Simulating satellite communication links: Beacon üì° Iridium**

---

## üåü Project Overview (V1.0)

SatMap is a React/TypeScript web application, now at **Version 1.0**, developed for the Space Handshakes Hackathon. It simulates a custom "Beacon" satellite orbiting Earth and visualizes its communication "handshakes" with the Iridium satellite constellation over a user-defined period. The simulation calculates key metrics such as total handshakes, communication blackout periods, and their durations.

Users can define the Beacon satellite's orbit type (Sun-Synchronous or Non-Polar) and its specific parameters (altitude, LST, inclination). The application dynamically generates a valid Two-Line Element set (TLE) for the Beacon based on these inputs, a critical feature for realistic custom orbit simulation.

This project demonstrates the integration of orbital mechanics calculations (using `satellite.js`), TLE data processing, dynamic TLE generation, and geometric communication modeling within a modern web application framework, culminating in an interactive 2D map visualization.

**‚ú® V1.0 Highlight:** The core simulation engine (`SatCore`) is robust and operational. The Beacon satellite's orbit is dynamically and correctly generated from user parameters into a valid TLE, enabling accurate propagation. The UI (`SatSimUI`) allows comprehensive configuration and detailed visualization of the simulation, including satellite tracks, active links, and handshake events. Critical bugs in TLE generation have been resolved, ensuring stable simulation runs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Core Logic (`SatCore`):** TypeScript, `satellite.js` (for orbital mechanics)
*   **Frontend (`SatSimUI`):** React, TypeScript
*   **Data Visualization:** `react-simple-maps`
*   **HTTP Requests:** `axios` (for fetching Iridium TLEs from CelesTrak)

## üß† Core Logic Flow

The simulation process in SatMap follows these key steps:

1.  **User Input (`OrbitInputForm.tsx`):** The user specifies the Beacon satellite's desired orbital parameters (type, altitude, LST or inclination) and general simulation settings (FOV for Iridium/Beacon, simulation duration, time step, Iridium datasets to use).
2.  **Beacon TLE Generation (`orbitCalculation.ts`):** Based on the user's parameters and the chosen epoch (simulation start time), SatMap dynamically calculates the necessary orbital elements and constructs valid TLE Line 1 and Line 2 strings for the Beacon satellite. This includes calculating mean motion, RAAN (derived for SSO, user-defined or default for Non-Polar), and ensuring correct formatting and checksums.
3.  **Iridium TLE Fetching (`tleService.ts`):** TLE data for the selected Iridium constellation(s) (original and/or NEXT) is fetched from CelesTrak. A fallback mechanism provides dummy TLEs if the live fetch fails.
4.  **Satellite Initialization (`orbitCalculation.ts`, `simulationEngine.ts`):** Both the dynamically generated Beacon TLE and the fetched Iridium TLEs are parsed into `SatRec` objects using `satellite.js`, making them ready for propagation.
5.  **Time-Step Propagation (`simulationEngine.ts`, `orbitCalculation.ts`):** The simulation iterates through time. At each time step:
    *   The ECI (Earth-Centered Inertial) position and velocity of the Beacon and all relevant Iridium satellites are calculated using the SGP4 propagator in `satellite.js`.
    *   Geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude) are derived for visualization.
6.  **Communication Link Detection (`simulationEngine.ts`, `geometry.ts`):**
    *   For each Iridium satellite, a nadir-pointing communication cone is defined based on its ECI position and the user-specified Iridium FOV.
    *   The Beacon's ECI position is checked against each Iridium satellite's communication cone using a point-in-cone geometric test.
7.  **Handshake & Blackout Logging (`simulationEngine.ts`):**
    *   A **handshake** is logged when the Beacon enters the communication cone of an Iridium satellite it wasn't previously connected to.
    *   A **blackout period** begins when the Beacon is not within any Iridium satellite's communication cone and ends when a connection is re-established.
8.  **Results Aggregation & Visualization (`App.tsx`, `SatVisualization.tsx`):**
    *   Total handshakes, blackout counts, and durations are calculated.
    *   Satellite tracks, active communication links, and handshake events are visually rendered on an interactive 2D map. A side panel provides details on selected satellites.
